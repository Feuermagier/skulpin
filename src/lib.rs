//! Skia + Vulkan = Skulpin
//!
//! This crate provides an easy option for drawing hardware-accelerated 2D by combining vulkan and
//! skia. (And a dash of winit!)
//!
//!
//! Currently there are two ways to use this library.
//!
//! # skulpin::App
//!
//! Implement the AppHandler trait and launch the app. It's simple but not as flexible as using
//! the renderer directly and handling the window manually.
//!
//! Utility classes are provided that make handling input and measuring time easier.
//!
//! # skulpin::Renderer
//!
//! You manage the window and event loop yourself. Then add the renderer to draw to it.
//!
//! This is the most flexible way to use the library
//!
//!
